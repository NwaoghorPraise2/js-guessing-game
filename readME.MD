## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://github.com/NwaoghorPraise2/js-guessing-game/blob/master/assets/images/screen-shot.png)

The objective of the game is to guess a random number generated by the computer within a certain range. The range of the game can be adjusted by the user. Once the user makes a guess, the game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. The user continues to make guesses until they correctly guess the number, at which point the game congratulates the player and prompts them to play again.

The game's code is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses JavaScript's Math.random() function to generate a random number within the user-specified range. The game logic is implemented using JavaScript conditional statements, loops, and functions.

Overall, the game is a simple yet fun way to test your guessing skills, and it provides a good opportunity for beginners to learn basic JavaScript concepts.
